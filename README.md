# SVG Manuscript Paper
Power to the digitally inclined artist

### Why

I just wanted some music paper that could be styled, open source and beautiful. 
I wasn't happy just printing out images, wanted to give a fully customizable tool

### To run

* You'll need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed in your system.
* Fork and clone the project:

```
https://github.com/RussellSnyder/manuscript-paper
```

* Then install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

* Run development server:

```
npm start
```

* Or you can run development server with [webpack-dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard):

```
npm run dev
```

Open the web browser to `http://localhost:8888/`

### To build the production package

```
npm run build
```

### Eslint
There is a .eslint.yaml config for eslint ready with React plugin.
To use it, you need to install additional dependencies though:

```
npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-react
```

To do the actual linting, run:

```
npm run lint
```
